## Otus Developer C++ Course
Homework "Clusterization"

Manual: https://john-jasper-doe.github.io/Lab15/index.html


## Running
To work, you need to install "gnuplot":

      $ sudo apt-get install gnuplot -y

Data from the "test_data" directory must be copied to the program directory. Configure permission to run scripts ("run_kkmeans_dat.sh", "run_sky_dat.sh" , "run_sky_color_dat.sh") for execution. Run scripts one by one.

NOTE: Maximum 5 clusters, because only 5 colors are set for drawing the graph. Otherwise, you will have to add it by hand)))
